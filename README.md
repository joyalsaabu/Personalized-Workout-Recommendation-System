# 🏋️ Personalized Workout Recommendation System

A web-based simulation of a **fitness recommendation engine**. This project generates personalized workout plans based on user inputs such as fitness goal, experience level, and training frequency. It demonstrates how a backend system built with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn could work, but is fully simulated in the browser using JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.

## 🌟 Key Features
- User Fitness Profile: Enter your primary goal, fitness level, and available days per week  
- Machine Learning Simulation: Mimics a recommendation model using predefined workout plans  
- Personalized Workout Plan: Automatically generates a training program based on input  
- Clean UI: Built with Tailwind CSS and responsive design  
- Interactive Experience: Instant plan generation without backend setup

## 🛠️ Technologies Simulated
- Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript  
- Machine Learning (simulated): Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
- Recommendation Logic: JavaScript-based decision mapping
